SYMMAX300 is a dataset of human annotations for symmetry axes of elongated structures for the complete Berkeley natural images dataset for segmentation (BSDS300). The ground-truth mat files contained in this directory are divided into the training set (200 images) and the testing set (100 images). Each mat file contains gt, a 2D binary matrix with values 1 in the pixels where we have a symmetry axis and 0 anywhere else. We also include an older version of the ground-truth dataset created following the procedure described in the paper, based on the BSDS300 segmentations. This lies under the folder "auto".

The names of the mat files are in the form gt_iid.mat, where iid is a unique integer id for every image in the BSDS300. If you already know the id for a specific image and the ground-truth directory is contained in your working directory, you can load the corresponding ground-truth simply by using:

load('gr_iid.mat')

Example of using the ground-truth in a for loop: (function imgList is included in the Berkeley segmentation benchmarking code) 

imagelist = imgList('train');
for i = 1:numel(imagelist)	
   iid = imagelist(i);
   load(sprintf('gt_%d',iid))
   gt = ...	%perform actions using gt
   ...
   ...
   ...
	
end

If you want to visualize the ground-truth on the corresponding image, you can use the overlayBinaryImage function included in our symmetry_1.0 distribution:

o = overlayBinaryImage(im,gt);
figure, imshow(o)
